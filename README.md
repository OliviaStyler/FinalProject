This project took a very long time, and was extremely complicated.
I designed the UI for a song editor application, where by selecting instruments and timings, a user is able to click and drag on the screen and create a song. 
The grid on the screen is meant to mimic the same octave structure as a typical piano, containing 12 notes.
